BitchX-GTK
==========

It has returned! The gtk version of BitchX hasn't worked in a dogs age, and unfortunately, over time, has not received the maintenance and updates the rest of BitchX has got. After doing a poll, and asking MANY people (thousands,) which was/is their favorite IRC client, and the common answers were, BitchX and BitchX if it still had a gtk version. AND SO IT BEGINS! Currently, I'm the only developer working on it, so its a slow process. On top of GTK, BitchX2 is on the todo list as well. For more information, check us out on Freenode in #BitchX !!
